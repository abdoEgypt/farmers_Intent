# farmers_Intent
The language of the data set is Arabic.
In the Egyptian agricultural research center there exist many text resources such as farmer problems system and extensions document for different crops. 
We focused on field crops due to its important economic value. 
Those crops include Maize, barley, wheat, onions, sorghum, soybeans, cotton, peanuts, sugar beets, flax, cowpeas, sesame, and fava beans. Extension document is a manual for farmers to guide them to select suitable varieties, specify plantation date, diseases, disease control, irrigation, fertilization and harvesting. For each intend, we extracted text that is related to it and then we added it to the data set. Also, we extracted text data from farmer problems system which are related to different intents.
